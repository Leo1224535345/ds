## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive job matching system using both array-based and linked list-based data structures. The system matches job descriptions with candidate resumes using weighted scoring algorithms and provides performance analysis between different implementations.

## Features
- **Dual Data Structure Implementation**: Both array-based and linked list-based storage
- **Advanced Job Matching Algorithm**: Weighted scoring with skill extraction and matching
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: QuickSort for arrays, MergeSort for linked lists
- **Search Algorithms**: Linear and binary search implementations
- **Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive comparison between data structures
- **Error Handling**: Robust data validation and error management
- **Interactive Testing**: User-friendly testing interface

## Technical Requirements Met

✅ Job matching component with appropriate algorithm (Weighted Scoring)  
✅ Driver program that tests the component  
✅ Performance evaluation for time and memory efficiency  
✅ Error handling and data validation

## Data Structures Implemented

### Array-Based Implementation
- **Storage**: Dynamic arrays for jobs and resumes
- **Sorting**: QuickSort algorithm (O(n log n) average case)
- **Searching**: Linear search (O(n)) and Binary search (O(log n))
- **Memory**: Contiguous memory allocation
- **Cache Performance**: Excellent due to spatial locality

### Linked List-Based Implementation
- **Storage**: Singly linked lists for jobs and resumes
- **Sorting**: MergeSort algorithm (O(n log n) guaranteed)
- **Searching**: Linear search only (O(n))
- **Memory**: Dynamic allocation with pointer overhead
- **Cache Performance**: Poor due to scattered memory locations

## Job Matching Algorithm

### Weighted Scoring System
The matching algorithm uses a sophisticated weighted scoring approach:

1. **Skill Extraction**: Automatically extracts relevant skills from job descriptions and resumes
2. **Common Skills Identification**: Finds overlapping skills between jobs and resumes
3. **Weighted Scoring Formula**:
   - 70% weight on skill match ratio (common skills / job skills)
   - 30% weight on coverage ratio (common skills / resume skills)
   - 20% bonus for exact skill matches
4. **Score Normalization**: Final scores are capped at 1.0

### Supported Skills
The system recognizes 25+ common technical skills including:
- Programming Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL
- Data Analysis: Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Pandas
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, MLOps, Deep Learning
- Development Tools: Git, Docker, REST APIs, Spring Boot
- Methodologies: Agile, System Design, User Stories

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
| Operation | Array Implementation | Linked List Implementation |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Search    | O(n) linear, O(log n) binary | O(n) linear only |
| Sort      | O(n log n) QuickSort | O(n log n) MergeSort |
| Insert    | O(1) amortized | O(1) |
| Delete    | O(n) | O(n) |

### Space Complexity
- **Array**: O(n) contiguous memory
- **Linked List**: O(n) + pointer overhead

### Memory Usage
- Array implementation uses less memory due to contiguous allocation
- Linked list implementation has overhead for storing pointers
- Memory usage scales linearly with dataset size

## Compilation and Execution

- C++11 compatible compiler (g++, clang++, etc.)
- Make utility
- 4GB+ RAM (for 10,000 record datasets)

### Build Instructions
```bash
# Compile the project

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
The program provides an interactive testing interface:
1. Choose implementation type (Array/Linked List/Both)
2. Enter resume ID to find matching jobs
3. View top matches with scores and common skills
4. Compare performance between implementations

### Program Output

## Algorithm Justification

### Why Weighted Scoring?
1. **Flexibility**: Allows fine-tuning of matching criteria
2. **Accuracy**: Considers both job requirements and candidate coverage
3. **Scalability**: Works well with large datasets
4. **Interpretability**: Scores are easy to understand and explain

### Why These Data Structures?
1. **Array**: Better cache performance, faster random access
2. **Linked List**: Dynamic memory usage, easier insertion/deletion
3. **Comparison**: Provides insights into trade-offs between approaches
